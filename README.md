# AlgoTrading

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I present to you the algorithmic trading program that I used in the prestigious Rotman International Trading Competition. Our program implements an arbitrage trading algorithm, designed to trade securities in both CAD and USD markets. The program trades BULL, BEAR, and RITC (BULL + BEAR) securities, and uses the Black-Scholes model to make informed trading decisions.

The Black-Scholes model is a well-known financial model used to estimate the price of European-style options. It takes into account various factors such as the current stock price, time to expiration, volatility, risk-free interest rate, and strike price, to calculate the theoretical price of an option. In our program, we use this model to determine the fair price of the securities we are trading, and to evaluate whether there is an arbitrage opportunity available.

The trading algorithm used in this program aims to exploit the differences in price between the CAD and USD markets for the securities we trade. By buying the security in the market where it is undervalued and selling it where it is overvalued, we can make a profit without taking on significant risk. Our algorithm uses various technical indicators and statistical models to identify these opportunities and execute trades in real-time.

During the Rotman International Trading Competition, we were able to achieve a commendable 15th position by leveraging the strength of our program. With the release of this repository, we hope to inspire others to develop their own algorithmic trading programs or improve upon our existing one. So go ahead, explore our code, and see if you can use it to create a successful trading strategy.
